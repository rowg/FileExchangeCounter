# FileExchangeCounter
Parses and summarizes SeaSonde FileExchange logs for easier monitoring of file transfers.

## Introduction
SeaSonde's FileExchange program fetches files from remote "radial" computers to a central "Combiner" computer. The log files generated by FileExchange contain lines showing the number of data files of each type that are transferred and the times of each transfer, but these log files are large and numerous and so are unsuitable for user monitoring of file transfer behaviour.

The scripts contained in the FileExchangeCounter parse the FileExchange logs and "boils them down" into summaries of the number of files of each type transferred in a given day. The more compact log files thus created are in turn summarized in a Web-browser viewable table for easy monitoring (the compact log files would be suitable for creating time-series plots of file-download volumes, but this has not been implemented).

## Motivation
An easy-to-read summary of a day's FileExchange file transfers is useful for two different reasons:

1. It alerts the operator to instances in which fewer than the expected number of files have been transferred; and

2. It alerts the operator to instances in which *more* than the expected number of files have been transferred.

The second case is the more important of the two, as it is less likely to be noticed by the operator.
